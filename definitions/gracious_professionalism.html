<h1><em>Gracious Professionalism®</em><a class="headerlink" href="#gracious-professionalism" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p><em>Gracious Professionalism®</em> is part of the ethos of <em>FIRST</em>. It’s a way of doing
things that encourages high quality work, emphasizes the value of others, and
respects individuals and the community.  <em>Gracious Professionalism</em> is not
clearly defined for a reason. It can and should mean different things to
everyone.</p>
<p>Some possible meanings of <em>Gracious Professionalism</em> include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>gracious attitudes and behaviors are win-win,</p></li>
<li><p>gracious folks respect others and let that respect show in their actions,</p></li>
<li><p>professionals possess special knowledge and are trusted by society to use that knowledge responsibly, and</p></li>
<li><p>gracious professionals make a valued contribution in a manner pleasing to others and to themselves.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In the context of <em>FIRST</em>, this means that all teams and participants should:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>learn to be strong competitors, but also treat one another with respect and kindness in the process, and</p></li>
<li><p>avoid leaving anyone feeling as if they are excluded or unappreciated.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Knowledge, pride, and empathy should be comfortably and genuinely blended.  In
the end, <em>Gracious Professionalism</em> is part of pursuing a meaningful life. When
professionals use knowledge in a gracious manner and individuals act with
integrity and sensitivity, everyone wins and society benefits.</p>

<div><p><em>The FIRST spirit encourages doing high-quality, well-informed work in a
manner that leaves everyone feeling valued. Gracious Professionalism seems
to be a good descriptor for part of the ethos of FIRST. It is part of what
makes FIRST different and wonderful.</em></p>

<p>It is a good idea to spend time going over this concept with your team and
reinforcing it regularly. We recommend providing your team with real-life
examples of <em>Gracious Professionalism</em> in practice, such as when a team loans
valuable materials or expertise to another team that they will later face as an
opponent in competition. Routinely highlight opportunities to display <em>Gracious
Professionalism</em> at events and encourage team members to suggest ways in which
they can demonstrate this quality themselves and through outreach activities.</p>
